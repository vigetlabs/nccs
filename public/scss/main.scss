// NOTES:
// This site utilizes a BEM approach to class naming: https://getbem.com/
// Block = standalone entity that has meaning on it's own
// Element = no standalone meaning, typically part of a block
// Modifier = a flag on a Block or Element
// 
// In addition several composable utility classes are used where a full block
// definition is uncessary or to increase re-usability of classes

// Base
@import "base/normalize";
@import "base/variables";
@import "base/globals";

// Components
@import "components/nav";

// Utility-classes
@import "utilities/screen-reader";

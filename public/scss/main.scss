// NOTES:
// This site utilizes a modified BEM approach to class naming:
// Block = standalone entity that has meaning on it's own
// Element = no standalone meaning, typically part of a block
// (Sassy/Simplified) Modifier = a flag on a Block or Element, written as `-mod`
// 
// In addition several composable utility classes are used where a full block
// definition is uncessary or to increase re-usability of classes

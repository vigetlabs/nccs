// NOTES:
// This site utilizes a modified BEM approach to class naming:
// Block = standalone entity that has meaning on it's own
// Element = no standalone meaning, typically part of a block
// (Sassy/Simplified) Modifier = a flag on a Block or Element, written as `-mod`
// 
// In addition several composable utility classes are used where a full block
// definition is uncessary or to increase re-usability of classes

// Base
@import "base/normalize";
@import "base/fonts";
@import "base/variables";
@import "base/functions";
@import "base/globals";
@import "base/type";
@import "base/flow";

// Components
@import "components/svg";
@import "components/button";
@import "components/nav";
@import "components/hero";

// Utility-classes
@import "utilities/screen-reader";
@import "utilities/layout";
@import "utilities/color";
@import "utilities/background";
@import "utilities/align";
@import "utilities/border";
